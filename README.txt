This application takes Chinese characters I want to learn, and formats them along with their pinyin into the correct format that I can then place into my flashcard app and learn.

Place Chinese characters into chars.txt and run the application. 

Please don't add any non-Chinese characters into the file (except for the special comma that the website I get my characters from uses, which is not the normal ",").
